1. modify Problem datatype to not include variable name.
2. remove all outdated vtk save formats
3. learn to apply periodic boundary conditions
4. change laplace example to reflect #1 and #2
5. Add cell lists for tracer-particle visualization code to make it run faster
6. integrate quadrature rules into elements/matrix generation
7. improve efficiency of Problem generation (in ProblemTypes.jl)
8. improve efficiency of solution interpolation (in MeshTransform.jl)
9. all drivers require the inclusion of a parameter list
10. clean up assembler/matrix generators. too much unused code and 
    I can't tell which is outdated and which isn't
11. write install file that a) adds eFEMpath file-name-path to correct location
                            b) installs all dependent Julia packages
                            c) does the above for Linux, Mac OS, and Windows computers
